# YANC
Yet. Another. Nixos. Configurator.  
[(☝️ Seemed like a ~~good~~ name at the time.)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html)

YANC is a personal project designed to streamline Nix configurations while deepening my understanding of the Nix language.

Built as a module for the excellent [flake-parts](https://github.com/hercules-ci/flake-parts) framework, YANC provides a structured approach to managing NixOS and other Nix-based configurations. It’s a work in progress, driven by a desire to simplify and organize my own setups.
